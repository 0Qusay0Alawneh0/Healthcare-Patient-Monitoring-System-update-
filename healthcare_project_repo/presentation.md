# Healthcare Patient Monitoring System
## Polyglot Persistence Implementation

---

## Use Case Analysis
- **Patient Information**: Heterogeneous data requiring flexible schema
- **Vital Signs**: Time-stamped measurements requiring time-series optimization
- **Doctor-Patient Relationships**: Complex network of relationships
- **Analytics**: High-volume data processing with regional partitioning
- **Alerts**: Real-time notification system requiring high performance

---

## Database Selection
- **MongoDB**: Document DB for patient information
  - Schema flexibility for varied medical records
  - Strong consistency for critical data
- **InfluxDB**: Time-series DB for vital signs
  - Optimized for time-based data
  - Downsampling capabilities
- **Neo4j**: Graph DB for relationships
  - Natural representation of healthcare networks
  - Efficient traversal for complex queries
- **Cassandra**: Column-family DB for analytics
  - Linear scalability for analytics workloads
  - Tunable consistency levels
- **Redis**: Key-value DB for alerts
  - Sub-millisecond response times
  - Pub/sub capabilities for notifications

## Implementation Details

### Regional Partitioning
- Patients partitioned by geographic region
- MongoDB: Sharding by region
- Cassandra: Region as partition key
- Redis: Region-based key prefixing

### Consistency Models
- Strong consistency: MongoDB (patient records)
- Eventual consistency: InfluxDB, Cassandra (time-series, analytics)
- Mixed consistency: Redis (critical vs. non-critical alerts)

### Replication Strategy
- MongoDB: 3-node replica sets
- InfluxDB: 3-node clusters
- Neo4j: Causal clusters with core servers and read replicas
- Cassandra: Multi-datacenter deployment
- Redis: Master-replica with sentinel

## Demonstration Highlights

### CRUD Operations
- Patient record creation, retrieval, update, deletion
- Vital sign data insertion and querying
- Relationship management in the graph database

### Fault Tolerance
- MongoDB node failure and recovery
- Redis master failure and sentinel failover
- Cassandra node resilience

### Performance Optimization
- Indexing strategies for each database
- Caching with Redis
- Query optimization techniques

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Consistency vs. Availability Trade-offs
- **Solution**: Different consistency models for different data types
  - Strong consistency for medical records
  - Eventual consistency for sensor data

### Challenge: Cross-Database Integration
- **Solution**: Event-driven architecture with message passing

### Challenge: Regional Compliance
- **Solution**: Data partitioning by region with local-first access
